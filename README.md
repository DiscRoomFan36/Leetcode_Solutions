# One Leetcode Problem Per Day

One Random Problem per day


## Quick Start

NOTE. this doesn't work, there is some random crash in nob.c, may fix later, but for now i just slap the problems in here. at least the git graph looks good.

```bash
# compile the build script once.
$ cc -o nob nob.c

# run
$ ./nob
# for now this will only check for compilation errors...
# no tests are run.
```
